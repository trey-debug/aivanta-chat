## Executive Summary

> *AIVANTA Automations is a Palm Harbor, Florida-based AI automation agency built by a BMW technician who saw the inefficiencies of auto repair shops firsthand and combined that experience with deep software development knowledge to solve them. This document captures the complete business strategy built from the ground up using Alex Hormozi's three core frameworks.*

**The Company:** AIVANTA Automations, LLC is co-founded by Trey (Chief Development Officer) and Ryan Davidson (Chief Sales Officer). The company specializes in done-for-you AI automation solutions for small and medium-sized automotive repair shops, delivered on 36-month contract terms with monthly retainer fees.

**AIVANTA's unique unfair advantage:** the lead developer is an active BMW technician who has personally witnessed every pain point the product solves — not a developer who read about the industry, but one who lives inside it daily.

**The Core Offer:** The 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop — a tiered AI automation system that eliminates the manual tasks draining shop owners' most valuable time, recovers lapsed customer revenue, and gives advisors their hours back to do what they do best: build the face-to-face relationships that drive lifetime customer value.

**The Problem Solved:** The average auto repair shop silently loses approximately $74,000 per year through four specific operational failures:
- Bad bookings from under-qualified online scheduling — wrong time slots, unprepared bays, frustrated customers
- Warranty and insurance phone tag — advisors frozen on hold for 1–2 hours per claim instead of building customer relationships
- Declined service revenue left on the table — 10–15 declined repair jobs per week never followed up on
- Lapsed customer revenue — customers who needed service, left, and were never contacted again

**The Revenue Opportunity:** At 10 active Growth-tier clients, AIVANTA generates $105,000+ per year in retainer revenue with near-zero marginal cost per additional client. Full upsell capture pushes blended client value to $42,000–$45,000 per contract, making 10 clients worth $420,000–$450,000 in contracted revenue.

### Three-Framework Summary

| Framework | Core Insight | AIVANTA Application |
|---|---|---|
| **$100M Offers** | Create an offer so good prospects feel stupid saying no | 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop with 4:1 ROI guarantee |
| **$100M Leads** | Get engaged leads through the Core Four advertising methods | Warm outreach + cold pipeline + AI scorecard lead magnet |
| **$100M Money Models** | Build a self-funding customer acquisition loop | Attraction > Core > Upsell > Downsell > Continuity stack |

---

## Part 1: The Offer — The 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop

> *Hormozi's principle: Make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no. The goal is to create a 'category of one' — where the prospect's only choice is between your offer and nothing at all.*

### 1.1 The Dream Outcome

The dream outcome was defined in two distinct layers, each appealing to a different buyer personality — but both solved by the same offer.

**Freedom Buyer:** Stop drowning in the chores of running the shop. Get back to the floor, to customers, to your kid's soccer game. Close the laptop on Friday feeling like you did the things that actually mattered — not the paperwork.

**Growth Buyer:** Recover the hours your best people are wasting on manual tasks and give them back to the high-value work that drives revenue — building relationships, closing jobs, calling back old customers.

> *Key insight: "The insurance company gets the sale. The advisor gets the customer." Every hour an advisor spends on hold with a warranty company is an hour they are NOT retaining a customer worth $4,000–$11,000 in lifetime value.*

---

### 1.2 The Pain — Quantified

| Pain Point | Weekly Cost | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Warranty/insurance hold time (4 hrs/wk @ $150/hr advisor rate) | $600 | **$31,200** |
| Mis-scheduled appointments (1 bad booking/wk @ avg repair order) | ~$400 | **~$20,800** |
| Lost retention from poor scheduling experience (2 customers/yr @ $11k LTV) | — | **~$22,000** |
| **TOTAL CONSERVATIVE COST OF INACTION** | | **~$74,000/year** |

Additional research context: The average auto repair shop customer LTV ranges from $4,000 (conservative) to $55,000+ (with referrals and multi-vehicle households). A Harvard Business Review study found that increasing customer retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25–95% in the automotive industry.

---

### 1.3 What AIVANTA Actually Builds

The five core automations were identified by mapping the shop's existing tech stack — CDK Service, CRM platform, DVI video software, parts/billing software, and labor time software — and finding the highest-leverage connection points between them.

| Automation | Pain It Solves | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Scheduling Agent** | Bad bookings, wrong time slots, frustrated customers at drop-off | Conversational AI phone/chat that asks diagnostic questions before booking — make, model, VIN, noise description, location, severity |
| **Tech Video Summarizer** | Advisor wasting 2–3 min watching each DVI video before calling customer | AI reads the DVI video/report and instantly produces a bullet-point summary delivered to the advisor's screen |
| **Declined Service Follow-Up** | 10–15 declined repair jobs per week — $9,000–$13,500 in weekly revenue never recovered | AI scans CRM, identifies declined jobs with promotional trigger logic, sends targeted offer at optimal re-engagement timing |
| **Customer Re-Engagement System** | Lapsed customers never contacted, advisor too busy to call them back | AI identifies dormant customers, triggers personalized outreach campaigns with offers — every response trackable |
| **Warranty Claim Prep Pack** | 1–2 hours of advisor time per warranty claim assembling documentation | AI pre-assembles the full claim packet — VIN, diagnostic codes, service history, photos, repair estimate — before advisor picks up the phone |

**Note on warranty automation:** Research confirmed that most extended warranty claims are initiated by phone (10 min to 2+ hours per call). AIVANTA does not eliminate the call but dramatically shortens it by preparing a complete claim packet in advance, turning a 2-hour process into a 20-minute one.

---

### 1.4 Proprietary Innovation — Predictive Re-Engagement

A proprietary automation concept emerged from direct shop floor observation: **predictive brake re-engagement**. The shop's DMS records brake pad measurements at every service visit. AIVANTA can build a system that calculates when a customer's previously noted measurement has likely reached the action threshold and automatically reaches out with a service offer.

> *Example: Customer was at 4mm brakes on last visit 4 months ago. Industry action threshold is 2mm. Average wear rate suggests they are now at or near threshold. AI triggers outreach: "We noticed your brakes were getting close at your last visit — it may be about time. We have an opening this Thursday. Want us to take a look?"*

**This is not a follow-up tool. It is a predictive maintenance marketing engine — and no competitor is currently offering this to independent shops.**

---

### 1.5 The Ongoing Monthly Retainer

The monthly retainer is what separates AIVANTA from a one-time project vendor and creates the 36-month contract value. Every tier includes:

- AI model updates — automations always run on the latest available technology
- Bug fixes and system maintenance — one throat to choke, all technical issues handled
- All hosting and infrastructure — clients pay one bill to AIVANTA, AIVANTA handles all vendor relationships
- Quarterly audits — on-site meetings with staff to find inefficiencies, gather feedback, optimize workflows
- Team training — every update and new feature comes with a return visit and staff training session
- Workflow optimization — continuous improvement, never set-and-forget

**The promise to the shop owner: you never have to think about any of this. It runs, it improves, and we handle everything.**

---

### 1.6 Three-Tier Pricing Architecture

| | **STARTER** | **GROWTH** | **TRANSFORMATION** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who It's For** | 1–3 advisors, under $1M revenue | 3–5 advisors, $1M–$3M revenue | 5+ advisors, $3M+ revenue |
| **Setup Fee** | $1,500 | $3,000 | $8,000 |
| **Monthly Retainer** | $597/mo | $997/mo | $1,497/mo |
| **36-Month Contract Value** | ~$23,000 | ~$38,900 | ~$61,900 |
| **AI Scheduling Agent** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Tech Video Summarizer** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Declined Service Follow-Up** | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Customer Re-Engagement** | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Warranty Claim Prep Pack** | — | — | ✅ |
| **Custom Workflow** | — | — | ✅ |

**Pricing Rationale — Why Not Charge Less:**
At the Growth tier, a full 5-automation build takes 40–50 hours of senior development time. A $3,000 setup fee equates to $60–75/hour for the most specialized, irreplaceable work in the engagement. That is freelancer pricing, not premium agency pricing.

> *Value-to-price check (Growth tier): Annual value delivered = ~$97,000. Annual cost to client = $3,000 + ($997 × 12) = $14,964. Value-to-price ratio = 6.5:1. Every dollar they spend returns $6.50. That is the definition of a no-brainer offer.*

---

### 1.7 The Guarantee — The 90-Day Re-Engagement Promise

> ***"Within 90 days of going live, our AI re-engagement system will bring back a minimum of 10 lapsed customers to your shop — or we work completely free until it does. Every appointment is tracked. Every result is measurable. No gray area, no fine print."***

**Guarantee qualifier:** Applies to shops with a minimum of 1,000 customers in their CRM from the past 12 months.

**The Guarantee Math:**

| | Numbers |
|---|---|
| Minimum database size | 1,000 customers |
| Industry average SMS/email re-engagement response rate | 3–8% |
| Expected responses from 1,000 customers | 30–80 |
| Our guarantee | 10 customers (33% of the low-end expectation) |
| Value of 10 recovered customers at $4,000–$11,000 LTV each | $40,000–$110,000 |
| Client's 90-day cost to AIVANTA | $1,500–$4,500 depending on tier |

> *Sales conversation framing: "We guarantee 10 customers back in 90 days. Our average shop sees 30–50. At $4,000 lifetime value per customer, that is $120,000–$200,000 in recovered revenue. You are paying us $1,500 a month. You do the math."*

---

## Part 2: Leads — The AIVANTA Customer Acquisition System

> *Hormozi's principle: There are only four ways to let anyone know about anything you sell — warm outreach, content, cold outreach, and paid ads. If you are not getting enough leads, you are not doing the Core Four with enough skill or enough volume.*

AIVANTA focuses exclusively on warm outreach and cold outreach as primary acquisition channels at this stage, with content serving as a trust-building amplifier and paid ads deferred until positive cash flow is established.

---

### 2.1 Four-Phase Lead Generation Strategy

| Phase | Timeline | Primary Activity | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Months 1–3 | Warm outreach to 2 known shop owners. Offer founding case study. Begin BMW shop documentation. | 2–3 clients + 1 documented case study |
| **2** | Months 3–6 | Cold pipeline: email > phone > in-person. Attend automotive summits and networking events. Deploy AI scorecard. | 5–7 additional clients |
| **3** | Months 6–12 | Referral program activated. Content running in background. Market study published as cornerstone asset. | Referrals become primary growth engine |
| **4** | Year 2+ | White-label and partner program. Coaches, consultants, and marketing agencies refer AIVANTA clients on recurring commission. | Scale beyond direct acquisition |

---

### 2.2 Warm Outreach — The First Two Clients

**Shop Owner #1 — The Internship Mentor**
Relationship: Church internship mentor who allowed visits to his shop during high school. Re-engagement approach: Follow up on the previous conversation about where things landed. This is not a pitch — it is a relationship follow-up that happens to lead somewhere valuable.

**Shop Owner #2 — The Family Friend**
Relationship: Family connection. Re-engagement approach: Simple genuine check-in first, no agenda. Let the conversation find its way to what AIVANTA is building before introducing the offer.

**The Founding Case Study Strategy:**
Offer one of these shop owners a free or deeply discounted engagement in exchange for documented access, measurable baseline data, and a testimonial.

- **Phase 1 — Baseline:** Document current process, measure time per task, record frequency, calculate weekly cost
- **Phase 2 — Build:** Implement automation, document architecture and infrastructure cost
- **Phase 3 — Outcome:** Same metrics post-automation. Time saved, appointments generated, revenue recovered
- **Phase 4 — The Story:** Before vs. after with hard numbers, formatted as a shareable one-page case study

---

### 2.3 Cold Outreach Pipeline

| Touch | Channel | Goal | Key Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Cold Email (Apollo.io / Hunter.io) | Plant the flag, create curiosity — do NOT pitch | 20–30% open rate, 3–5% reply rate |
| **2** | Phone Call | Get 5 minutes — not a sale | "I sent you an email about something we're doing for auto shops in Tampa..." |
| **3** | In-Person Drop-In | Face time with owner or service manager | Leave behind: one-page case study or scorecard QR code |
| **4** | Automotive Events & Forums | Warm up cold contacts before pipeline hits them | Name recognition before email = dramatically higher open rates |

**Lead sources:** Automotive business summits, Facebook groups for shop owners, Google Maps (every shop has a listing), Apollo.io or Hunter.io for email lists, industry coaching platforms and forums.

---

### 2.4 The Lead Magnet — The AI Automation Scorecard

The AI Automation Scorecard is simultaneously AIVANTA's **lead magnet, product demonstration, and qualification filter**. No other competitor can offer anything like it because it requires the same AI development capabilities that power the core product.

**What Makes It Exceptional:**
Unlike a static form or PDF, the scorecard is a live AI conversation built in n8n that:
- Asks the questions that matter — and follows up intelligently based on answers
- Demonstrates AIVANTA's AI capabilities in real time, during the sales process itself
- Produces a personalized score showing the shop's automation readiness and revenue leak
- Sends a branded email summary of the full conversation
- Offers to book a discovery call — as a natural next step, not a forced CTA

> *The strategic insight: By the time a shop owner gets on a discovery call, they have already experienced AI automation firsthand. They used AIVANTA's product to analyze their own shop. They are not evaluating whether AI works — they know it does. They are deciding whether to expand it.*

---

### 2.5 Content Strategy — The Unfair Advantage

Content is deployed as a trust amplifier and credibility builder, not as a primary lead source at this stage.

**The Core Brand Story:**
AIVANTA's biggest unfair advantage is the one no competitor can copy: the founder is an active BMW technician who built an AI company because he personally witnessed every problem it solves.

> *"I've been taking things apart and putting them back together since I was five years old. By the time I was sixteen, that obsession landed on cars. I became a BMW technician. But the longer I spent in shops, the more I saw something that bothered me — owners working themselves into the ground, advisors buried in paperwork, good people missing their kids' soccer games because they were on hold with a warranty company. I looked around and thought: I know how to fix this. So I built AIVANTA. I'm still turning wrenches at BMW. I see these problems every single day. That's exactly why AIVANTA exists — because the shops that win aren't the ones doing what everyone else does. They're the ones doing what nobody else even thought to do yet."*

**Content Pillars:**
- **The Insider** — filmed in the shop, under a car, talking about problems AIVANTA solves in real time
- **The Proof** — before/after results with hard numbers from real shop implementations
- **The Education** — breaking down the $74,000 leak so owners feel seen and understood
- **The Demo** — screen recordings of automations in action: scheduling agent, video summarizer, re-engagement campaigns

**Platform Strategy:**

| Platform | Content Type | Strategic Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Facebook Groups** | Educational posts, comments in shop owner groups | Where shop owners actually congregate — high direct access |
| **LinkedIn** | Case studies, industry insights, professional positioning | Where shop owners go to look credible — builds B2B authority |
| **YouTube / TikTok** | Shop floor videos, product demos, origin story | Highest trust-building medium — video proves authenticity |
| **Instagram** | Behind the scenes, results, brand building | Visual proof and social credibility |

---

### 2.6 The Proprietary Market Study

Trey has daily access to a working BMW shop where every pain point AIVANTA solves is observable in real time. Starting immediately, the following baseline data should be collected and documented — **before a single paying client is onboarded.**

| What to Track | How to Track It | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Warranty hold time per incident | Note start/end time on phone notes | Builds the hold-time cost baseline with real data |
| Declined services per day | Count from MPI recommendations | Quantifies the weekly revenue leak precisely |
| Follow-up rate on declined services | Does anyone call them back? When? | Proves the gap AIVANTA fills |
| Time between brake measurement and action threshold | Pull from service history | Validates the predictive re-engagement model |
| Advisor time on non-customer tasks per shift | Rough estimate per shift | Builds the opportunity cost argument with real numbers |

Two weeks of this data produces a proprietary market study: *"AIVANTA spent 30 days inside a high-volume BMW dealership measuring the true cost of manual processes. Here is what we found."* This document becomes the lead magnet, the cold email hook, the sales deck foundation, and the PR story all at once.

---

## Part 3: Money Models — The Self-Funding Acquisition System

> *Hormozi's principle: Build a money model where every new customer generates enough profit within 30 days to pay for their own acquisition AND fund the next customer. When this is achieved, cash is no longer a limiter — only operations constrain growth.*

---

### 3.1 Current Unit Economics — An Extraordinary Starting Position

| Monthly Fixed Cost | Amount |
|---|---|
| n8n Cloud | $24/month |
| Google Workspace | $90/month |
| Claude Pro | $17/month |
| **TOTAL CURRENT FIXED COSTS** | **$131/month** |

Additional per-client variable costs (API usage, dedicated infrastructure): estimated $30–80/month per client. These pass-through costs are absorbed within the retainer margin.

| Active Clients | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Costs | Monthly Profit | Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $997 | ~$231 | **$766** | $9,192 |
| 3 | $2,991 | ~$431 | **$2,560** | $30,720 |
| 5 | $4,985 | ~$631 | **$4,354** | $52,248 |
| 10 | $9,970 | ~$1,131 | **$8,839** | $106,068 |
| 20 | $19,940 | ~$2,131 | **$17,809** | $213,708 |

> *Critical insight: Because AIVANTA's costs are almost entirely fixed, every new client beyond the first is nearly pure profit margin. The 10th client costs almost exactly the same to service as the 1st client in terms of hard costs. This is the unit economics of a scalable software business, not a services business.*

---

### 3.2 The Four Monetization Mechanisms

**Mechanism 1 — Attraction Offer**
The free AI Automation Scorecard. Zero cost to the prospect, zero hard cost to AIVANTA. Generates engaged leads by solving a specific narrow problem (revealing the revenue leak) and routing qualified prospects into the discovery call pipeline.

**Mechanism 2 — Core Offer**
The 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop. Three tiers, 36-month contracts, full done-for-you delivery. The primary revenue engine.

**Mechanism 3 — Upsell Stack**
Three upsells offered at the point of signing (when momentum and trust are highest). Combined, they increase the value of every Growth-tier client by $8,734 over the contract term.

| Upsell | Setup Fee | Monthly Add-On | Why They Say Yes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Operations Playbook — branded PDF + video library documenting every automation | $500 | — | "I just signed a 36-month contract — I want my team to use this properly" |
| Live Performance Dashboard + Monthly ROI Report | $500 | $97/mo | "I want to see exactly what I'm getting for my money every day" |
| AI Review Generation System — Vapi voice call walks customers through leaving a Google review | $750 | $97/mo | "More Google reviews directly means more cars in my bay" |
| **TOTAL UPSELL VALUE PER CLIENT (over 36 months)** | **$1,750** | **$194/mo** | **+$8,734 per client** |

**Mechanism 4 — Downsell Stack**
Three distinct downsells mapped to the three most common objections. Without a downsell, every objection is a lost deal. With a downsell, every objection has a path to yes.

| Objection | Downsell Offer | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **"36 months is too long"** | 12-month contract at +20% monthly | Shorter commitment = higher monthly rate = same risk protection for AIVANTA. Growth tier: $997 > $1,197/mo. They get flexibility; AIVANTA gets higher MRR if they churn early. |
| **"I can't afford $3,000 upfront"** | No setup fee + 30% higher monthly permanently | Growth tier: $0 setup + $1,296/mo. Over 12 months = $15,552 vs $14,964 base. AIVANTA actually earns more. Client feels immediate relief. |
| **"I need to think about it"** | $250 MCP Tripwire Tool — lightweight standalone AI assistant on 12-month agreement | Gets card on file. Creates daily product usage. Builds trust through experience. Switching cost created. Follow-up call in 30–60 days converts at dramatically higher rate than cold pitch. |

> *The tripwire insight: A prospect who says "I need to think about it" is really saying "I don't trust you enough yet" or "the commitment feels too big." The $250 MCP tool makes the first yes feel almost trivial — but once they use AIVANTA's product daily, inertia works in your favor.*

---

### 3.3 The Complete Self-Funding Loop

| Stage | Mechanism | Product / Offer | Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Attract** | Free lead magnet | AI Automation Scorecard | $0 — generates engaged leads |
| **Convert** | Core offer | 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop (3 tiers) | $1,500–$8,000 setup + $597–$1,497/mo |
| **Maximize** | Upsell stack | Playbook + Dashboard + Review System | +$8,734 per client over 36 months |
| **Recover** | Downsell stack | Flexible contracts + $250 tripwire | Captures revenue from every objection |
| **Retain** | Continuity | 36-month retainer with full managed services | $21,492–$53,892 per client over term |
| **Scale** | Partner program | Coaches, consultants, agencies on 10–30% recurring commission | Exponential growth without proportional marketing spend |

---

### 3.4 The Partner & White-Label Program

The partner program turns every trusted advisor in the shop owner's existing vendor ecosystem into a commission-earning sales force for AIVANTA.

| Partner Type | Why They Are Perfect | Commission Model | Example Earnings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Automotive Business Coaches (ATI, Elite Worldwide, RLO Training)** | Inside the shop's financials and operations. Recommendations get implemented immediately. | 15% recurring on all referred client monthly revenue | 5 clients = $748/mo forever |
| **Shop Management Consultants** | Solving same problems as AIVANTA — manually. AIVANTA makes their recommendations stick. | White-label: 25–30% of all revenue from their clients | 10 clients = $2,493/mo |
| **Automotive Marketing Agencies** | Already billing the shop monthly. Can bundle AIVANTA tools into existing packages. | 10–15% recurring referral fee | 5 clients = $499–$748/mo |
| **Shop Management Software (Tekmetric, Mitchell1, Shop-Ware)** | Every user is a pre-qualified AIVANTA prospect. Native integrations create marketplace visibility. | Revenue share — negotiated per partner | Potentially thousands of referrals |

> *White-label opportunity: A consultant with 20 active shop clients could potentially represent 20 AIVANTA contracts overnight — branded as their own "AI Profit System — Powered by AIVANTA" — without a single cold email from AIVANTA's sales team.*

---

## Part 4: Capacity Constraints & Scaling Plan

> *The most honest and important strategic insight: development capacity is AIVANTA's first bottleneck, and it will break before sales does. Identifying this now — before scaling — is what prevents the quality collapse that kills agencies between clients 5 and 15.*

### 4.1 Current Capacity Reality

- **Trey:** deep system architecture, AI development, full-stack builds — irreplaceable at this stage
- **Ryan:** sales, client relationships, simple automations — not yet equipped for complex builds
- Full 5-automation build: 40–50 hours of senior development time
- Available development hours per week (after BD/sales/admin): approximately 20–25 hours

| Build Scenario | Hours Per Client | Max Clients/Month (Solo) |
|---|---|---|
| Full 5-automation build | 40–50 hrs | 1 client/month |
| 2–3 automation build | 15–25 hrs | 2–3 clients/month |
| 1 automation build (Starter tier) | 5–10 hrs | 4–5 clients/month |

---

### 4.2 The Scaling Solution

**Step 1 — Productize the Build (Months 1–6)**
Document every automation as a repeatable template. Identify which components are truly "Trey-level" architecture versus which are configuration and setup that could be handled by a trained no-code specialist. Goal: reduce the irreplaceable-Trey-hours per client from 40–50 to 10–15.

**Step 2 — Hire or Contract a Developer (Month 4–8)**
Once the first 3–4 clients are generating stable MRR, use that revenue to bring on a junior developer or no-code specialist. At $8,839/month profit from 10 clients, a $3,000–$5,000/month developer hire is easily sustainable and immediately multiplies capacity.

**Step 3 — Tier Client Intake by Complexity (Ongoing)**
Starter tier clients (5–10 hour builds) can be handled by a junior developer with Trey's oversight. Growth and Transformation tier clients are reserved for Trey until the team expands.

| **VALUE-TO-PRICE RATIO** | | **6.5:1 minimum** |

---

### 5.2 Revenue Projections — Path to $100k and Beyond

| Milestone | Clients | Monthly MRR | Annual Retainer | Setup Fees | Annual Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | 3 | $2,991 | $35,892 | $9,000 | **$44,892** |
| **Phase 2** | 8 | $7,976 | $95,712 | $24,000 | **$119,712** |
| **Phase 3** | 15 | $14,955 | $179,460 | $45,000 | **$224,460** |
| **Phase 4** | 30 | $29,910 | $358,920 | $90,000 | **$448,920** |

*Projections assume Growth tier pricing ($997/mo, $3,000 setup) across all clients. Blended upsell capture and Transformation tier upgrades would push these numbers significantly higher. Partner program revenue not included in these projections.*

## Part 6: Immediate Action Plan

### This Week — Non-Negotiable Actions
1. Contact Shop Owner #1 (internship mentor) — follow up on the career advice conversation from last year. Reactivate the relationship before pitching anything.
2. Begin BMW shop documentation — warranty hold time, declined services per day, follow-up rate. Start building the proprietary market study baseline.
3. Build the AI Automation Scorecard in n8n — the lead magnet that demonstrates capabilities and qualifies prospects simultaneously.
4. Draft the 60-second origin story — the technician-turned-AI-founder narrative that becomes the hook for every piece of content, every cold email, and every sales conversation.

### This Month — Build Phase
5. Finalize the three-tier pricing page and offer one-pager for each tier.
6. Build Apollo.io lead list of Tampa Bay auto repair shops with owner contact information.
7. Write the cold email sequence (3-touch: email > phone follow-up > in-person visit).
8. Onboard first founding case study client — document baseline, build first automation, begin measuring outcomes.

### Next 90 Days — Revenue Phase
9. Produce the founding case study with hard before/after numbers.
10. Attend first automotive summit or networking event with case study in hand.
11. Launch cold outreach pipeline — 50–100 contacts per week minimum.
12. Close 2–3 paying clients and establish first recurring MRR.
13. Identify and contact first potential white-label or referral partner (one automotive coach or consultant).

**AIVANTA Automations, LLC | Palm Harbor, Florida | 2026**
