## Executive Summary

### Situation

AIVANTA Automations is a Palm Harbor, Florida-based AI automation agency specializing in custom automation solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Founded in September 2025 (LLC established December 2025), AIVANTA helps SMBs bridge the technology gap by delivering done-for-you AI automation systems that solve real business problems and drive measurable outcomes. Current monthly revenue: **$3,200 (February 2026)**.

### Mission

> AIVANTA architects bespoke AI operating systems, uniquely tailored to the operational DNA of each client. We integrate a custom suite of technologies to serve as the intelligent core for any business — from emerging startups to established enterprises — amplifying human ingenuity by automating the ordinary so our clients can achieve the extraordinary.

### The Grand Slam Offer

Following rigorous application of Hormozi's three business frameworks ($100M Offers, $100M Leads, and $100M Money Models), AIVANTA has refined its go-to-market strategy around a flagship vertical offer: **The 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop** — a done-for-you AI automation system built exclusively for automotive repair shops. This offer serves as AIVANTA's initial beachhead market — the deepest, most documented pain, with the most measurable outcome, and the founding team's most authentic insider advantage.

> *Trey McCormick is an active BMW technician who built an AI company because he personally witnessed every problem it solves. This is not a marketing angle — it is a movement that no competitor can replicate.*

### Market Opportunity

The AI automation-as-a-service market is projected to grow from **$10.15 billion in 2025 to $33.12 billion by 2030**. Despite this growth, 52% of SMBs cite insufficient internal skills as a barrier to AI adoption, and only 23% have meaningfully implemented AI despite 96% planning to do so. AIVANTA's sweet spot is this implementation gap — businesses who want AI but cannot build or maintain it themselves.

### Financial Objectives

| Metric | 2026 Target | 2028 Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Annual Revenue** | $118,000+ | $1,080,000+ |
| **Total Contract Value Sold** | $720,000+ | $4,320,000+ |
| **Direct Clients** | 30+ | 180+ |
| **White-Label Clients** | 50+ | Expanding nationally |
| **Net Profit Margin** | 35% | 35% |

### 1.2 Leadership

**Trey McCormick — Founder & Chief Development Officer**

Trey oversees all development projects, strategic planning, and technical execution. With deep expertise in AI automation workflows, n8n, React applications, and API integrations, Trey ensures AIVANTA delivers high-quality, scalable solutions. His curiosity-driven approach means understanding every detail of how systems work — enabling AIVANTA to build automations that truly solve problems rather than adding complexity.

Beyond his technical background, Trey's most significant competitive asset is that **he is an active BMW technician**. He works inside a high-volume shop daily, observing firsthand the exact inefficiencies AIVANTA was built to solve. This gives AIVANTA an unfair advantage no competitor can replicate: deep operational credibility in the automotive vertical.

> *"I've spent hundreds of hours researching AI, how to use it, how it works, and understanding every finite detail to get the full picture. This depth allows us to build solutions that work seamlessly for our clients."*

**Ryan Davidson — Co-Founder & Chief Sales Officer**

Ryan brings a customer-first mentality shaped by growing up in a family of realtors who taught him that success comes from listening and understanding people's needs. He oversees sales, marketing, brand development, and business operations. Ryan's approach focuses on building genuine relationships and treating automation as a tool to help businesses thrive — not just a product to sell.

> *"Success comes from truly understanding people's needs and putting clients' concerns first. That's the same approach I bring to automations — smart, seamless, and built for real results."*

## 3. Problem We're Solving & Our Solution

### 3.1 The Problem — SMBs Recognize AI's Value But Can't Implement It

Research shows that 78% of businesses use AI in at least one function, but only 23% have meaningfully implemented it. Meanwhile, 96% plan to adopt AI, and 52% cite insufficient internal skills as the primary barrier.

**Pain Points AIVANTA Addresses:**
- **Understanding Capabilities:** Businesses don't understand what AI can actually do for them or how to customize it for their specific needs
- **Technical Complexity:** SMBs lack the technical expertise to build, integrate, and maintain AI automation systems
- **High Upfront Costs:** Traditional automation agencies charge large setup fees ($10K–$50K+) that price out most small businesses
- **Implementation Risk:** Business owners fear investing in technology that won't work, won't integrate, or will become obsolete quickly
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Even when automation gets built, businesses struggle with troubleshooting, updates, and optimization

### 3.2 The Automotive Repair Shop Vertical — AIVANTA's Beachhead Market

Through direct shop floor observation and industry research, the automotive repair shop segment was identified as AIVANTA's most powerful beachhead vertical. The average auto shop silently loses approximately **$74,000 per year** through four specific, quantifiable operational failures:

| Pain Point | Weekly Loss | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Warranty/insurance hold time — advisors on hold 1–2 hrs per claim instead of serving customers | $600 | **$31,200** |
| Bad bookings — wrong time slots, unprepared bays, frustrated customers at drop-off | ~$400 | **~$20,800** |
| Declined service revenue lost — 10–15 declined repair jobs per week with zero follow-up | $9,000–$13,500 | **Massive — uncapped** |
| Lapsed customer revenue — dormant CRM contacts never re-engaged | — | **$40,000–$110,000 in lost LTV** |
| **TOTAL CONSERVATIVE ANNUAL COST OF INACTION** | | **~$74,000/year** |

---

### 3.3 Our Solution — Done-For-You AI Automation on Affordable Multi-Year Contracts

AIVANTA eliminates these barriers by providing:
- **Custom Automation Systems:** We build AI solutions tailored to each business's specific workflows, challenges, and goals
- **Affordable Contract Model:** Instead of $25K upfront, spread costs over 3-year contracts with monthly payments — making enterprise automation accessible
- **Complete Implementation:** We handle discovery, design, development, integration, testing, training, and deployment
- **Ongoing Support & Optimization:** Every contract includes continuous support, troubleshooting, updates, and quarterly system improvements
- **No Technical Expertise Required:** Clients tell us their problems — we deliver working solutions they can use immediately

## 5. Competitive Analysis

### 5.1 Competitor Landscape

| Competitor Type | Price Point | Customization | SMB Focus | Ongoing Support | Relationship |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Enterprise Agencies** | $100K+ | High | Low | Yes | Professional |
| **SaaS Platforms (Zapier, Make)** | $50–300/mo | Low | High | Limited | Transactional |
| **Small Agencies** | $5K–25K | Medium | Medium | Variable | Mixed |
| **AIVANTA** | $597–$1,497/mo | High | High | Yes | Family-Style |

---

### 5.2 AIVANTA's Unique Competitive Advantages

**Faith-Based Foundation & Integrity**
We align every decision with the word of God, operating with integrity rooted in eternal principles. This differentiates AIVANTA with faith-aligned business owners and creates accountability competitors cannot claim.

**The Technician-Founder Advantage**
Trey McCormick is an active BMW technician. He is not a developer who theorized about shop pain points — he has lived every one of them. This is a narrative and credibility advantage that no competitor agency can manufacture.

**White-Label Partnership Model**
AIVANTA partners with marketing agencies, business coaches, and consultants to deliver automation under their brand — creating a capital-efficient, scalable growth engine with lower CAC, faster scaling, and predictable pipeline from established client bases.

**Contract Model Accessibility**
Spreading automation value over 36-month contracts makes enterprise-grade solutions accessible to businesses with $750K–$5M revenue — a massive underserved market that enterprise agencies cannot profitably serve and SaaS tools cannot adequately support.

**Long-Term Support Included**
Every contract includes 3 years of support, updates, and optimization. Competitors often charge separately for ongoing maintenance or abandon clients post-deployment.

## 6. Service Offerings & Pricing Model

### 6.1 The Flagship Offer — The 90-Day AI Supercharged Shop

> ***Headline: "How Tampa Bay Auto Shop Owners Are Putting $50,000 Back In Their Pocket Every Year — Without Hiring A Single New Employee"***

**The Five Core Automations:**

| Automation | Pain It Solves | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Scheduling Agent** | Bad bookings, wrong time slots, frustrated customers at drop-off | Conversational AI handles phone/chat bookings — asks make, model, VIN, problem description, severity before confirming slot |
| **Tech Video Summarizer** | Advisors waste 2–3 minutes watching each DVI inspection video before calling customers | AI reads the DVI report and instantly delivers a bullet-point summary to the advisor's screen |
| **Declined Service Follow-Up** | 10–15 declined repair jobs per week — $9,000–$13,500 in weekly revenue never recovered | AI scans CRM, identifies declined jobs, sends targeted offers at optimal re-engagement timing |
| **Customer Re-Engagement System** | Lapsed customers never contacted — advisor too busy to call them back | AI identifies dormant customers and triggers personalized outreach campaigns — every result trackable |
| **Warranty Claim Prep Pack** | 1–2 hours of advisor time per warranty claim assembling documentation while on hold | AI pre-assembles the full claim packet — VIN, codes, history, photos, estimate — before advisor picks up the phone |

**Proprietary Innovation — Predictive Re-Engagement:**
A novel automation concept identified from direct shop floor observation: the shop's DMS records brake pad measurements at every service visit. AIVANTA can calculate when a previously noted measurement has likely reached the action threshold and automatically reach out with a service offer. This is not a follow-up tool — it is a **predictive maintenance marketing engine** that no competitor currently offers independent shops.

Clients never have to think about the technology running their shop.

---

### 6.3 The 90-Day Guarantee

> ***"Within 90 days of going live, our AI re-engagement system will bring back a minimum of 10 lapsed customers to your shop — or we work completely free until it does. Every appointment is tracked. Every result is measurable. No gray area, no fine print."***

**Qualifier:** Applies to shops with a minimum of 1,000 customers in their CRM from the past 12 months.

| The Guarantee Math | Numbers |

---

### 6.4 Value Stack — Growth Tier

| Deliverable | Annual Value to Shop |
|---|---|

| Tech Video Summarizer — advisor time recovered | $15,600 |

| Full Hosting & Infrastructure Management | $3,600 |
| **TOTAL VALUE DELIVERED / YEAR** | **$97,000–$167,000** |
| **ANNUAL CLIENT INVESTMENT (Growth tier)** | **$14,964** |
| **VALUE-TO-PRICE RATIO** | **6.5:1 minimum** |

---

## 7. Customer Acquisition Strategy

### 7.1 Target Customer Profile

**Automotive Repair Shop (Initial Beachhead Vertical):**

| Characteristic | Profile |
|---|---|
| **Shop Size** | 1–10 service advisors |
| **Annual Revenue** | $750K–$5M |
| **Tech Maturity** | Using a DMS (CDK, Tekmetric, Mitchell1) but no automation |
| **Primary Pain** | Advisors buried in manual tasks instead of building customer relationships |
| **Dream Outcome** | Freedom buyer: get to kid's soccer game. Growth buyer: drive more revenue with fewer wasted hours. |
| **Buying Trigger** | Lost revenue from declined services, staff overwhelm, warranty phone-tag frustration |
| **CRM Minimum** | 1,000+ customers (for guarantee eligibility) |

**Broader SMB Profile (General Market):**
- Business Age: 3–15 years in operation
- Annual Revenue: $750K–$5M
- Team Size: 5–50 employees
- Growth Stage: Established and growing, feeling operational strain
- Pain Point: Overwhelmed with manual tasks, repetitive work, data entry
- Buying Trigger: Hiring challenges, scaling pains, pre-exit optimization

---

### 7.2 The Lead Generation System

**The AI Automation Scorecard — Lead Magnet & Product Demo:**
The AI Automation Scorecard is simultaneously AIVANTA's lead magnet, its product demonstration, and its lead qualification filter. Built in n8n, it is a live AI conversation that:
- Asks the questions that matter and follows up intelligently based on responses
- Demonstrates AIVANTA's AI capabilities in real time, during the sales process itself
- Grades the shop's automation readiness and calculates their hidden revenue leak with a dollar figure
- Sends a branded email summary of the full conversation and results
- Offers to book a discovery call as a natural next step

> *By the time a shop owner gets on a discovery call, they have already experienced AI automation firsthand. They are not evaluating whether AI works — they know it does. They are deciding whether to expand it.*

**Four-Phase Acquisition Plan:**

| Phase | Timeline | Primary Activity | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Months 1–3 | Warm outreach to 2 known shop owners. Founding case study offer. Begin BMW shop documentation. | 2–3 clients + 1 case study |
| **2** | Months 3–6 | Cold pipeline: email > phone > in-person. Automotive summits and networking events. AI scorecard deployed. | 5–7 additional clients |
| **3** | Months 6–12 | Referral program activated. Content running. BMW shop market study published as cornerstone sales asset. | Referrals become primary growth engine |
| **4** | Year 2+ | White-label and partner program at scale. Coaches, consultants, and marketing agencies referring on recurring commission. | Scale beyond direct acquisition |

**Cold Outreach Pipeline:**

| Touch | Channel | Goal | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Cold Email (Apollo.io/Hunter.io) | Plant the flag, create curiosity — do NOT pitch | 20–30% open rate target, 3–5% reply rate |
| **2** | Phone Call (2–3 days later) | Get 5 minutes — not a sale | Reference the email, build curiosity |
| **3** | In-Person Drop-In | Face time with owner or service manager | Leave one-page case study or scorecard QR code |
| **4** | Automotive Events & Forums | Warm up cold contacts before pipeline | Name recognition before email = dramatically higher open rates |

**Content Strategy — The Unfair Advantage:**
Content serves as trust amplifier and credibility builder — deployed in the background while warm and cold outreach drive immediate revenue.
- **The Insider:** In-shop videos under cars talking about problems AIVANTA solves in real time
- **The Proof:** Before/after results with hard numbers from real shop implementations
- **The Education:** Breaking down the $74,000 leak so owners feel seen and understood
- **The Demo:** Screen recordings of automations in action — scheduling agent, video summarizer, re-engagement campaigns

---

### 7.3 Sales Process

1. **Automation Scorecard Completion** — Prospect completes AI conversation and receives personalized revenue leak report
2. **3-Email Nurture Sequence** — Scorecard results + case study (Day 1), cost of inaction (Day 2), discovery call invitation (Day 3)
3. **Discovery Call (15 min)** — Confirm pain points, present high-level solution, explain contract model and pricing, book strategy session or close
4. **Strategy Session (45 min, for larger opportunities)** — Deep-dive into business processes, custom automation roadmap, ROI projection, contract signing
5. **Onboarding & Kickoff** — Welcome email, project kickoff call, discovery documentation, development timeline confirmation

---

## 8. Money Models — The Self-Funding Acquisition System

> *Principle: Build a money model where every new customer generates enough profit within 30 days to fund the next customer's acquisition. When this is achieved, cash is no longer a limiter — only operations constrain growth.*

### 8.1 Unit Economics

| Monthly Fixed Cost | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| n8n Cloud | $24 | Scales with usage |
| Google Workspace | $90 | Business suite |
| Claude Pro | $17–$100 | Upgrades at first client |
| Per-client variable (API/hosting) | $30–$80/client/mo | Absorbed in retainer margin |
| **TOTAL FIXED BASE** | **~$131/month** | **Before first client** |

| Active Clients | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Costs | Monthly Profit | Annual Run Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $997 | ~$231 | **$766** | $9,192 |
| 5 | $4,985 | ~$631 | **$4,354** | $52,248 |
| 10 | $9,970 | ~$1,131 | **$8,839** | $106,068 |
| 20 | $19,940 | ~$2,131 | **$17,809** | $213,708 |

> *Key insight: Because AIVANTA's costs are almost entirely fixed, every new client beyond the first is nearly pure margin. The 10th client costs almost the same to service as the 1st. This is software-business unit economics inside a services business.*

---

### 8.2 Upsell Stack

| Upsell | Setup | Monthly | Why They Buy |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Operations Playbook — branded PDF + video library documenting every automation | $500 | — | "I just signed a 36-month contract — I want my team using this correctly" |
| Live Performance Dashboard + Monthly ROI Report | $500 | $97/mo | "I want to see exactly what I'm getting every single day" |
| AI Review Generation System — Vapi voice call walks customers through leaving a Google review | $750 | $97/mo | "More Google reviews means more cars in my bay" |
| **TOTAL ADDITIONAL VALUE PER CLIENT (36 months)** | **$1,750** | **$194/mo** | **+$8,734 per client** |

---

### 8.3 Downsell Stack

| Objection | Downsell Offer | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **"36 months is too long — I don't know you yet"** | 12-month contract at +20% monthly rate | Growth tier: $997 becomes $1,197/mo. Shorter commitment = higher monthly = same downside protection for AIVANTA. |
| **"I can't afford $3,000 upfront"** | Two options: (1) Roll into monthly until paid, then deploy. (2) No setup fee + 30% higher monthly permanently. | Growth tier Option 2: $0 setup + $1,296/mo. Over 12 months = $15,552 vs. $14,964 base. AIVANTA earns more. Client feels immediate relief. Win-win. |
| **"I need to think about it"** | $250 MCP Tripwire Tool — standalone AI assistant on 12-month lightweight agreement | Gets card on file. Creates daily product usage and trust. Switching cost is created. 30–60 day follow-up call converts at dramatically higher rate than a cold pitch. |

> *The tripwire insight: Once a prospect uses an AIVANTA product daily, they have to actively decide to leave — rather than just passively not signing. Inertia now works in AIVANTA's favor.*

---

### 8.4 Partner & White-Label Program

| Partner Type | Why They're Perfect | Commission Model | Example Earnings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Automotive Business Coaches (ATI, Elite Worldwide, RLO Training)** | Inside the shop's financials and operations. Their recommendations get implemented immediately. | 15% recurring on all referred monthly revenue | 5 clients = $748/mo forever |
| **Shop Management Consultants** | Solving the same problems as AIVANTA — manually. AIVANTA makes their work stick. | White-label: 25–30% of all revenue from their clients | 10 clients = $2,493/mo |
| **Automotive Marketing Agencies** | Already billing the shop monthly. Can bundle AIVANTA tools into existing packages. | 10–15% recurring referral fee | 5 clients = $499–$748/mo |
| **Current Partner: Digital South** | Active white-label relationship, launched Q1 2026. Model for additional partnerships. | Active | Expanding Q2 2026 |

## Conclusion

AIVANTA Automations is positioned to capture significant market share in the rapidly growing AI automation market by serving an underserved segment: small and medium-sized businesses — starting with automotive repair shops in the Tampa Bay region — who recognize AI's value but lack the expertise and budget to implement it.

Our values-driven approach, specific and measurable offer, accessible contract-based pricing, and commitment to long-term client success differentiate us from every transactional competitor in our market. By aligning with the word of God, practicing intentional stewardship, maintaining customer obsession, and pursuing excellence with determination, we are building a business that creates lasting impact.

Our three-framework strategy — a Grand Slam Offer backed by a 90-day guarantee, a four-phase lead generation system powered by a product-as-lead-magnet AI scorecard, and a self-funding money model with upsell and downsell architecture — creates a durable engine that compounds with every client added.

**2026 is the foundation year. 2027–2028 is the expansion phase.** The goal is not just to reach $100,000 or 30 clients — it is to establish AIVANTA as the trusted automation partner that Tampa Bay businesses, and eventually Florida businesses, call first when they are ready to stop doing manually what machines should do.
